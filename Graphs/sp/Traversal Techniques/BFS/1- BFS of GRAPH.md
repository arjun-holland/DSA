# üîÑ Breadth-First Search (BFS) ‚Äì Graph Traversal

Breadth-First Search is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices **level by level** starting from a source node. 
It uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to visit.

## üìò Code Summary

This C++ code:
- Takes input of `n` nodes and `m` edges.
- Builds an **adjacency list** to represent the graph.
- Performs BFS starting from `source = 1`.
- Outputs the order of nodes visited and their levels (distance from the source).

## üì¶ Data Structures Used

| Structure | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `vector<int> G[]` | Adjacency list |
| `queue<int> q` | BFS queue |
| `used[]` | Marks visited nodes |
| `level[]` | Stores depth from source |

---

## üîÑ BFS Algorithm Steps

1. Enqueue the **source** node and mark as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a node.
   - For each unvisited neighbor:
     - Mark as visited.
     - Set its level to current node's level + 1.
     - Enqueue it.

## üìå BFS Properties

| Feature | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time Complexity | `O(V + E)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(V)` |
| Type | Level-order traversal |
| Good For | Shortest path in unweighted graphs, Layer-wise exploration |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Applications of BFS

- Finding shortest path in **unweighted** graphs
- Peer-to-peer networking (like BitTorrent)
- Crawling the web (like Googlebot)
- Social networking (finding degrees of separation)
- GPS navigation (simplified models)

---

## üí° Bonus Tip:
Use BFS when you need the **shortest path** or want to explore **closest neighbors first**. For trees, it's ideal for **level-order traversal**.
