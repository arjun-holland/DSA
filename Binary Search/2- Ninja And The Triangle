/*
Problem statement
Ninja has been given ‘N’ stars. Ninja has to make a triangle using these stars.
The ‘i’th’ level of a triangle contains a ‘i’ number of stars.

Can you help Ninja to make a triangle as large as possible using these stars?

For example:
Let the number of stars is 6.
Then we can make a triangle of maximum height 3.

Note:
If the number of stars is 7 in the above example, then also the maximum height of the triangle is 3. 
This is because to make a triangle of height 4 we need at least 10 stars. So in this case (N = 7) to we will return 3.

        if (totalStars <= n) {
            ans = mid;
            low = mid + 1; // try a larger height
        } else {
            high = mid - 1; // try a smaller height
        }
