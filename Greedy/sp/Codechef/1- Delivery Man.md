# Problem
```
Andy and Bob are the only two delivery men of Pizza-chef store. Today, the store received N orders.
It's known that the amount of tips may be different when handled by different delivery man. More specifically,
if Andy takes the ith order, he would be tipped Ai dollars and if Bob takes this order, the tip would be Bi dollars.
They decided that they would distribute the orders among themselves to maximize the total tip money.
One order will be handled by only one person. Also, due to time constraints Andy cannot take more than X orders and Bob cannot
take more than Y orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be
handled by either Andy or Bob.
Please find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money after processing all the orders.

Input
The first line contains three integers N, X, Y.
The second line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Ai.
The third line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Bi.

Output
Print a single integer representing the maximum tip money they would receive.

Constraints
All test:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^5
1 â‰¤ X, Y â‰¤ N;
X + Y â‰¥ N
1 â‰¤ Ai, Bi â‰¤ 10^4

ðŸ’¥ Brute Force Intuition â€“ Complete Version
Weâ€™re given: N orders Andy can take at most X orders,Bob can take at most Y orders
Tip for each order differs based on who delivers:
      Andy's tips = A[0...N-1]
      Bob's tips = B[0...N-1]
Our goal: Assign each order to either Andy or Bob such that: No one exceeds their max limit and Every order is assigned and
The total tips are maximized

# Optimal Intuition
```
We have: N orders.
Two people: Andy and Bob.
For each order product i:
If Andy delivers â†’ we get A[i] tips.
If Bob delivers â†’ we get B[i] tips.

âœ… Goal:
Maximize total tips, but: Andy can take at most X orders and Bob can take at most Y orders.
X + Y â‰¥ N â†’ All orders will be delivered, just need to choose wisely who does which.

ðŸ’¡ Core Idea
We want to assign orders in such a way that we maximize the tip difference (gain) by selecting the better person for each order.
But we're constrained by X and Y.
```
```
Let's Build the Intuition:
- Base Case: Suppose Bob delivers all orders â†’ total tips = sum(B).
- Now for each order, check:
      If Andy delivers instead, how much extra tip do we get? â†’ diff[i] = A[i] - B[i]
              sum(B) + A[i] - B[i] as in total bobs tips we add the specific i'th product tip of andy and remove that product bob's tip
      If diff[i] is positive, itâ€™s better to give that order to Andy.
        Highest positive gain = Andy is much better
        Negative gain = Bob is better
        If gain is high â†’ Andy should deliver
        If gain is low â†’ Bob should deliver

- But we can only give X orders to Andy.
- So, sort diff[] in descending order:
- Take top X values (the largest gains from switching Bob â†’ Andy) Add those gains to base case (sum(B)).
