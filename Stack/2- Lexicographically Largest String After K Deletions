/*
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k, your task is to remove exactly k characters from the string.
The resulting string must be the largest possible in lexicographical  order, while maintain the relative order of the remaining characters.

Examples:
Input: s = "ritz", k = 2
Output: tz 
Explaination: By removing two characters in all possible ways, we get: "ri", "rt", "rz", "it", "iz", and "tz". Among these, "tz" is lexicographically largest string.
Input: s = "zebra", k = 3

Output: zr 

Explaination: Removing "e", "b", and "a" results in "zr", which is lexicographically largest string.

Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^5
0  ≤  k < s.size()

public:
    string maxSubseq(string& s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        int keep = n - k;  // number of characters to keep
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) freq[c - 'a']++;

        string ans = "";
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']--;

            // Remove smaller characters from end while k removals remain
            while (!ans.empty() && ans.back() < c && k > 0) {
                ans.pop_back();
                k--;
            }

            // If we still need characters to fill subsequence, add current char
            if ((int)ans.size() < keep) {
                ans.push_back(c);
            } else {
                // Skip current character to remove it
                k--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
