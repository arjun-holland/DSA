The question after reading the question you understand that we have to take the K elements from the array
either from the starting or beginning
if you assume we are taking only X elements from the beginning so we have to take the K - X elements from the end
so it says that we have to use the prefix array and the suffix array
where prefix array gives prefix array of I use the we are taking the I elements from the array here I is nothing but X
so if you take I from starting then we have to take only the K - I elements from the end that means suffix array
