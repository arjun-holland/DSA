/*
Given a number represented as a string s (which may be very large), check whether it is divisible by 13 or not.

Examples:
Input : s = "2911285"
Output : true
Explanation: 2911285 / 13 = 223945, which is a whole number with no remainder.

Constraints:
1 â‰¤  s.size()  â‰¤ 10^5
*/

class Solution {
  public:
    bool divby13(string &s) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + (c - '0')) % 13;
        }
        return remainder == 0;
    }
};

/*
ðŸ§  How It Works:
Processes the number one digit at a time.
Maintains only the remainder mod 13, never storing the full number.
Uses this math property:
(a * 10 + b) % m == ((a % m) * 10 + b) % m
