/*
Given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return true if these points are a boomerang.
A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

Example :
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
*/

class Solution {
public:
    bool isBoomerang(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        return (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) * (points[2][1] - points[1][1]) != (points[1][1] - points[0][1]) * (points[2][0] - points[1][0]);
    }
};

//Intuition: for a straigth line  with three points , the slope between the points (a,b) and points (b,c) are same.

(y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = (y3-y2) / (x3-x2) ==> (y2-y1) * (x3-x2) = (y3-y2) * (x2-x1)
