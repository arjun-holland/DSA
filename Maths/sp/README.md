# ðŸ“˜ What Is Math in DSA & OA?
Mathematics in DSA and OA isnâ€™t about solving equations with a calculator â€” 
itâ€™s about using logical, numerical, and analytical tools to build efficient, correct, and optimized algorithms.

# ðŸ”§ How Math Is Used in DSA/OA:
1. Designing Efficient Algorithms
    You need math to analyze time and space complexity.
    Example: Knowing that O(log n) is better than O(n) helps you choose binary search over linear search.

2. Solving Programming Challenges
    Most OA and CP problems involve:
    - Modulo math
    - GCD/LCM
    - Permutations/Combinations
    - Probability or expected value
    - Bitwise operations
    
3. Understanding Problem Constraints
   Math helps you spot patterns, edge cases, and optimize brute-force solutions.
   For instance, calculating sum of 1 to n using the formula 
                 n(n+1)/2
   instead of looping through n times.

4. Mathematical Proofs of Correctness
  Algorithms often need to be proven mathematically correct (especially for edge cases).
  Recurrence relations and induction are key here.

5. Geometry & Coordinate Calculations
   Problems involving 2D grids, vector math, or angles require basic geometry.
