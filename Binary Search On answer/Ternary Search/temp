Terinary search is used whenever we don't have a certain condition to do the binary search on answer.
generally binary search on answer technique has a certain condition to control the left and right pointers ,
if we have to control the left and right pointers but why don't have the certain condition then we have
to use the ternary search this is quite same as the binary search on answer approach but here we are 
actually finding the 2 mid value position and we have to consider the minimum or the maximum depending upon 
the answer.
