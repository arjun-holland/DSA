/*
You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the position of a stall.
You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

Examples :
Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], 
the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and 
the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
