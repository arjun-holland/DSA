# ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement (Rewritten Clearly):
```
Given an undirected acyclic graph (i.e., a tree), where each node has at most 3 neighbors,
Find a vertex such that if you root the tree at this vertex, the resulting tree will be a valid binary tree.
```

# process :
```
Ask the interviewer :
-> How many nodes can be in the graph? -> 100000
-> Sir is this is a single connected component graph given in input -> Yes (means we hasve to decide its a tree);
-> Sir, are there multiple edges in the graph?-> No (means we hasve to decide its a tree).
come to final Observation -
- Given graph is a tree -> such that each node has maximum 3 edges. 
- We are given a tree; where each node <= 3 edges. 
- We have to decide which node should be selected as the root so that the tree becomes a binary tree. 
Each node of a binary tree has 2 children. 
The input tree will have this property - each node will have at max 2 children except the root node.
(-> root node can have 3 children which distorts the validity of being a binary tree.) 
                       1
                    /  |  \
                   2   3    4
                 / \   / \   / \
                5   6  7  8  9  0
        
Strategy - Select a node which has 2 edges or 1 edge(best option) - then it can always be converted to a binary tree. 
-> Proof :- The only problem is that the root of the input tree might have 3 children or else the problem is already solved.
 The root is assumed for input tree is the answer if it is already attached to two nodes only 
-> In case; the root has 3 child; then selecting the leaf of the tree always works.
